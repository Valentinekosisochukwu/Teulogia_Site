  Backend engineers manage all of our tech infrastructure, from our cutting edge AI communication system to machine learning pipeline and our data collection platform. Our infrastructure moves fast and changes rapidly with strong requirements on reliability, throughput, and e2e latency. We don’t particularly care what technical stack you’re most familiar with as long as you are familiar with a standard tech stack (we’ll teach you the rest!). However, it is important to be ready for intense onboarding. We would like to get you, within the human ability to do so, up and running ASAP.
            </p> <br>
